4.1 – The while Loop

For the following assignment, write your answers for numbers 1 and 3 inside of one word document with the filename: 4.1WhileLoop.docx. For problem # 2 write 3 separate java files. See below for the program names. Upload the document and 3 java files to GitHub.

The link to the assignment will be on Remind or go to:

1.	What does the following loop print?
int n = 1;
while (n < 100)
{
	n = 2 * n;
System.out.print(n + “ “);
}

2.	Write a while loop that prints:
+a.	All squares less than n. For example, if n is 100, print 0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81.
++i.	Name this program: WhileLoopSquares
+b.	All positive numbers that are divisible by 10 and less than n. For example, if n is 100, print 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90.
++i.	Name this program: WhileLoopTen
+c.	All powers of two less than n. For example, if n is 100, print 1 2 4 8 16 32 64
++i.	Name this program: WhileLoopPowersTwo

3.	What is an infinite loop? On your computer, how can you terminate a program that executes an infinite loop?
